The course I most recently completed on DataCamp was "Intro to Python for Data Science". Out of the 7 DataCamp courses I have completed, this one is my favorite.

Since Fall 2017, I have assigned "Intro to Python for Data Science" as homework to all students taking the Introduction to Python (BIOF309) course (https://github.com/marskar/biof309_fall2018) I teach at the Foundation for Advanced Education in the Sciences (FAES).

About a month into the Fall 2017 semester, the DataCamp mobile app was released with a mobile version of "Intro to Python for Data Science". Since then, I have recommended that everyone learning Python complete the both the desktop and mobile versions of "Intro to Python for Data Science".

I greatly appreciate that this and other DataCamp courses are made freely available to students thanks to the "DataCamp for the Classroom" initiative!

I really like how the "Intro to Python for Data Science" course brings learners up to speed with Python, in particular by teaching them to interact with a python script by sending lines of code from a Python script to an IPython shell.

Based on my experiences teaching Python and R, I know it is important to build up basic workflow skills along with essential programming language concepts from the very beginning. In fact, I focus on workflows and different ways to run Python code in the first class of my Intro to Python course at FAES.

I also like that functions, modules, and packages are introduced early on in "Intro to Python for Data Science", before loops, logic, control flow and filtering in "Intermediate Python for Data Science".

"Intro to Python for Data Science" does a great job of explaining the logic behind why packages are divided into modules and why Python does not include every function as a builtin. In fact, the only thing I would have done differently would have been to introduce the idea of importing user-defined functions from python scripts in the local file system. In essence, I believe learners should not only understand the principle of modularity, but also how to apply it to their own code.

This concept could very easily fit within the math module examples in the "Functions and Packages" chapter of "Intro to Python for Data Science". For example, learners could first define a function that returns the cube of any number.

Then, the description for the next exercise could say that the cube function is saved in a module called cube.py that is located in the current working directory. In that exercise, learners could import their own cube function and compare it with the pow function from the math module (take a look at the example here https://github.com/marskar/biof309_fall2018/blob/master/cube/cube-vs-pow.py, try out an interactive version using Binder https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/marskar/biof309_fall2018/master?filepath=cube/cube.ipynb).

This simple example does not add much additional cognitive burden and empowers learners by showing them that writing and importing their own modules can be easy. It makes the gap between Python users and a Python developers seems less insurmountable!
