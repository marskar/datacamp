Creating Robust Python Projects

In a few sentences, please describe why your experience has prepared you to teach a course on this topic. *

I work with Python every day. I have taught Python in a classroom setting and developed Python materials for online courses. Each of these experiences required that I organize code into projects.

Step 1: Brainstorming
In order to have a clear idea of what you will teach in your course, we ask that you answer the following questions.

What problem(s) will students learn how to solve? *
How to go about setting up a data science or software development project, using project templates and following widely accepted conventions with regard to standard components, e.g. README, LICENSE, setup.py, __init__.py, and modules.

What techniques or concepts will students learn? *
How to automate tasks, create and use project templates, write useful documentation, and organize code in the form of a Python package consisting of Python modules, so that code can be reused, maintained, and shared more easily. The course will culminate in publishing a package to PyPI (pypi.org)!

What technologies, packages, or functions will students use? *
The Python import statement to access class and function definitions in the project modules, (py)pandoc to translate markdown to reStructuredText and then Sphinx to convert reStructuredText to create webpages that beautifully document code, cookiecutter to create project templates, and GNU Make to automate tasks.
