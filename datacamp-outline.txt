Creating Robust Python Projects

In a few sentences, please describe why your experience has prepared you to teach a course on this topic. *
I work with Python every day. I have taught Python in a classroom setting and developed Python materials for online courses. Each of these experiences required that I organize code into projects.
Step 1: Brainstorming
In order to have a clear idea of what you will teach in your course, we ask that you answer the following questions. 
What problem(s) will students learn how to solve? *
How to go about setting up a data science or software development project.
What techniques or concepts will students learn? *
How to automate tasks, version control files, create and use project templates, manage dependencies, write useful documentation, and organize code in the form of a Python package consisting of Python modules, so that code can be reused, maintained, and shared more easily.
What technologies, packages, or functions will students use? *
GNU Make or Snakemake (to automate tasks), git (to version control files), pip or conda (to manage dependencies), markdown (for documentation), cookiecutter (to create project templates), and the import statement to access class and function definition in the project modules.
