Creating Robust Python Projects

In a few sentences, please describe why your experience has prepared you to teach a course on this topic. *

I work with Python every day. I have taught Python in a classroom setting and developed Python materials for online courses. Each of these experiences required that I organize code into projects.

Step 1: Brainstorming
In order to have a clear idea of what you will teach in your course, we ask that you answer the following questions. 

What problem(s) will students learn how to solve? *
How to go about setting up a data science or software development project, following widely accepted conventions with regard to standard components, e.g. README, License, requirements.txt, setup.py, __init__.py, modules, packages and tests.

What techniques or concepts will students learn? *
How to automate tasks, version control files, create and use project templates, manage dependencies, write useful documentation, and organize code in the form of a Python package consisting of Python modules, so that code can be reused, maintained, and shared more easily. The course will culminate in publishing a package to TestPyPI (test.pypi.org)!

What technologies, packages, or functions will students use? *
(Py)pandoc to translate markdown to reStructuredText and then Sphinx to convert reStructuredText to create webpages that beautifully document code,  GNU Make or automate tasks, git to version control files, pipenv or conda to manage dependencies, unittest, pytest and doctest for testing, cookiecutter to create project templates, travis for continouus integration, and the import statement to access class and function definitions in the project modules.
