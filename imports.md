Python comes with [Batteries Included](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0206/#batteries-included-philosophy)!

Built-in objects (builtins) are ready-to-use, right out-of-the-box. 

Builtins do not need to be imported with the `import` statement.

The easiest way to list all of the builtins is to import the `builtins` object. 
```
import builtins
help(builtins)
